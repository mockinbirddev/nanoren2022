    a "**I don't need school. I need to find what's out there for me.**"

    a "**Finn is right. We're almost done and I won't have to deal with this anymore.**"

    a "**I promised my dad I wouldn't use what he taught me for bad things but I just can't stand it.**"

    a "**I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.**"

    a "**First off, I'll need to get a place. On the bus here I saw a few places that are available.**"

    a "**If I can get a place then I won't have to live with mom and her stupid boyfriend anymore.**"

    a "**Money. I need to find out how to get some money. I don't think getting a job will cut it right now.I need a really quick transaction done.**"

    a "**Do I really want to do this? It'll put me in the same league as the black hats.**"

    a "**It can't be helped. I'm tired. Let's do this. What banks are nearby. Something small.**"

    a "**Ahh, Melrose Bank. Small and local, perfect. Their information is solid. I wonder how their network security is.**"

    a "**It's actually pretty weak. This will be child's play.**"

    a "**Not a lot of customers here, but what's strange is that there's a lot of money in each of these accounts.**"

    a "**Let me open up another termial and wire it into my bank account.**"

    a "**Thank God Dad opened this for me in secret. I guess he knew Mom would try to take some out without me knowing.**"

    a "**The security for my bank is a lot stronger, so it looks like this will take longer than I thought.**"

    a "**$200, huh?**"

    a "**Looks like if I take $10k out of each account I should have a million dollars. I don't think this is going to be risky.**"

    a "**These guys are rich! I don't think they'll cry over a measly $10,000. Let's do this. I'll just make sure to cover my tracks.**"

    a "**There, done. I'm a millionaire. The first step into the real world begins today. But first, I need to make sure I graduate.**"

    a "**I don't think my English Lit teacher will put in a good word for me after that whole fiasco.**"

    a "**Let's see. What was the network information of the school again? Let me ping their local IP and see if I can trace it back.**"

    a "**It's easier for me to get into the bank system because most of the IP addresses are tied behind the URL of the site, making it easier to ping.**"

    a "**It also helped that Melrose Bank's security was weak.**"

    a "**Here we go, I'm in the directory. Now where am I? Ah, here I am, Adam Martinez.**"

    a "**C's and D's. I should make it somewhat realistic, so let's put some B's and an A in gym. I don't know how I would get a C in P.E., but an A will suffice.**"
